## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before setting up CTFBot, ensure you have the following:

- Python (v3.8 or higher)
- Discord.py (v2.0 or higher)
- A Discord bot token (You can obtain one from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/code-vinci/ctfbot.git
   cd ctfbot
   ```

3. Configure the bot by creating a `.env` file in the project root:

   ```env
   DISCORD_TOKEN="<token>"
   ```

4. Start the bot:

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   docker-compose up
   ```

5. Take down the bot:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down --volumes
   ```

## Usage

Invite the bot to your Discord server and use the configured prefix (default: `!`) to interact with it. For example:

- `/create <name>`: Add a new CTF challenge.
- `/create_challenge`: Add new text channel to discuss about challenge.
- `/flag`: Marks the challenge as solved with a ðŸš© emoji.
- `/hackerman`: Send a fancy hackerman's gif.
